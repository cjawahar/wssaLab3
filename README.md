# wssaLab3

This repository houses the Arduino files for WSSA Lab 3: Serial Communications on Embedded Devices.
The I2C and SPI protocols were tested during this lab.

Part 1 of the lab is within I2C_1 and Part 2 is within SPI_1. 
Part 3 of the lab deals with Power Consumption of both protocols and is held in two folders -- I2C_Power and SPI_Power. The consumption was measured by Powerdue Powerscope.

The I2C protocol was tested with the LSM303C breakout board. 
The SPI protocol was tested with the FXOS8700CQ magnetometer located on the same breakout board.
